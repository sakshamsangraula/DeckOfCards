# DeckOfCards

This project creates the number of decks of cards specified in the parameter (here 2 decks of cards are specified as the argument). An arraylist stores all the cards in the deck, shuffles the cards, and displays the cards. Finally, a number of cards specified in the parameter of the dealCards function is removed from the original arraylist(decreasing the size of the arraylist) and a new arraylist containing only those cards is returned.
